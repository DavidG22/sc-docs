Appendix - Future Enhancements to Stratis Smart Contracts
###############################

We are committed to continually improving Stratis smart contracts. Future enhancements include:

* Improvements to the validation output. For example, plans exist to show the line where non-deterministic code has been detected.
* Further integration with Microsoft Visual Studio so live feedback is provided during coding. This will identify potential bugs, non-deterministic code, and also suggest improvements for the smart contract.
* Support for event and logs to facilitate communication between smart contracts and their user interfaces. 
* Support for a web3 library to facilitate communication between smart contracts and web applications. 
* Improvements to the testing utilities. This includes the ability to auto-generate a blockchain state and the ability to measure the gas required for a smart contract method call.
* Standard interfaces for common smart contracts. This includes an ERC20-type token interface.
* A self-destruct functionality for smart contracts.
* NuGet distribution for common smart contract libraries.
