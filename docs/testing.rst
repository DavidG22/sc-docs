.. warning::
  Testing of Stratis Smart Contracts is still primitive. Future versions of smart contracts will enable testing with the resource tracking code injected, and on top of a local test blockchain. The tests as described here do check that the smart contract logic executes as expected, but contracts should be tested on a live network.
