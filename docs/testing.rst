With Stratis Smart Contracts, your tests can be developed and debugged using C# inside Visual Studio. The tests as described here verify that your smart contract logic executes as intended, before you deploy it to a live network.

.. info::
  Testing of Stratis Smart Contracts is still primitive. Future versions of smart contracts will enable testing with the resource tracking code injected, and on top of a local test blockchain.
