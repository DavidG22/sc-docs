Getting Started

.. note::
    This section assumes a Windows development environment. Stratis Smart Contracts can be developed on other platforms - documentation is coming soon.

The following

What you'll need:

* `Visual Studio <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/>`_
    The standard IDE for C# development. The Community Edition is available for free.

* `Stratis Smart Contract Visual Studio Solution Template <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/>`_
    A template .NET Core solution with a sample contract project and sample unit testing project.

* `Stratis' Command Line Smart Contract Tool <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/>`_
    To validate your contracts, and more easily compile and deploy them.

.. note::
    In future releases the command line tooling will be replaced with a more complete Visual Studio integration.

Once the template has been installed, in Visual Studio you can navigate to File > New > Project… and create a new ‘Stratis SmartContract Project’ under ‘Visual C#’.
